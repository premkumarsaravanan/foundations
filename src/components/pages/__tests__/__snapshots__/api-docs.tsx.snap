        HTTP Methods
      </H5>
      <p>
        Foundation APIs present a uniform interface for performing CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations. Each endpoint adheres to REST guidelines to map the correct verb to the operation being performed. Our APIs support the following HTTP methods:
      </p>
      <Table

      <p>
        Foundation APIs use standardised HTTP status codes to indicate whether a request has been successful or has resulted in an error. Below is a listing of the codes our APIs may return and their meaning:
      </p>

      <p>
        The Foundation platform uses 
        <a
          href="https://openid.net/connect/faq/"
        >
          OpenID Connect
        </a>
         (OIDC) as it's Authentication protocol, based on the OAuth 2.0 specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our authentication mechanisms allow you to quickly build apps on top of our platform and provide a seamless authentication experience for your end users.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Registering your application
      </H5>
      <p>
        Your application must be registered with our Marketplace before it can interact with data, functionality and assets provided by the Foundations API. For more information on how to register your application, see our Marketplace documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of creating your application, you'll be required to choose the
         
        <a
          href="https://oauth.net/2/scope/"
        >
          scopes 
        </a>
        that you application requires. Scopes govern the actions that your application can perform against our services. Each endpoint will detail the scopes that an application must be granted in order to interact with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your application has been successfully registered, you will be provided with a unique application id which is required to interact with our authorization services.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Client installation
      </H5>
      <p>
        Once your application submission has been approved by Reapit, it will appear as a listing in our Marketplace. Reapit clients will then be able to interact with your application's details and potentially choose to install it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the installation process, clients are required to agree to the scopes that your application requires before your application becomes accessible to end users. Applications cannot interact with client data or assets without prior approval from the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once installed, an application can access Foundation services on an end users behalf. The recommended way to achieve this is to use one of our Client Libraries, however you can interact directly with our APIs as detailed below.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Create an authorization code
      </H5>
      <p>
        To create an OAuth 
        <a
          href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/"
        >
          authorization code
        </a>
        , direct users to the URL documented below where they'll be prompted to enter their credentials. The clientId parameter is required and provided during the Marketplace app registration process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            GET https://foundations.reapit.com/oauth/authorize?clientId=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon success, the service will direct back to your application with an authorization code provided as a query string.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            https://application.company.com/?code=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <H5>
        Exchange code for tokens
      </H5>
      <p>
        If your application has successfully guided the end user through the OAuth flow and obtained an authorization code, you need to send it along with the client id issued to your application during Marketplace registration to the following endpoint:
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-4"
      >
        <pre>
          <code>
            POST https://foundations.reapit.com/oauth/access_token
            
  {
    "clientId" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "code" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuing a request with a valid authorization code and client id will provide a response in the following format:
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-4"
      >
        <pre>
          <code>

      <p>
        Upon recieving an access token, the Foundation will validate the token to ensure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The access token is valid, issued from the correct source and not tampered with&gt;
        </li>
        <li>
          The access token contains the required scopes to perform the action that the endpoint requires
        </li>
        <li>
          The applications access to the end users data has not been revoked.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Developer Sandbox
      </H4>
      <p>
        You can use the Foundation API in Sandbox mode which provides a set of demonstration data that can be interacted with without affecting any client environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon registering with our developer portal, you can immediately get familiar with the functionality our APIs offer and enjoy a hurdle free route to start developing your application
      </p>
      <p>
        Sandbox mode supports processing of all read and write requests so that you can build and test in confidence before submitting your application to our Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the sandbox, you'll need to register for a developer account at our Portal. You're then able to simply use those credentials provide them to our Authorization services in the normal way. The access token generated for your developer credentials will point our APIs at your sandbox data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, our Interactive API Explorer will automatically grant access to sandbox data when you're logged into the Developer Portal.
      </p>
      <H4>
        Errors
      </H4>
      <p>
        Unsuccessful requests return an error response in JSON format. This includes a status code, a time stamp and textual description of the error:
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-4"

        Resource expansion
      </H4>
      <p>
        Some of the top level resources made available by the platform include resource expansion functionality. When fetching data from a resource expansion enabled endpoint, clients can optionally request that a response includes data from one or more related resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ability is to designed to reduce the number of required client-server roundtrips to obtain the data that a client needs for a specific use-case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Query parameters are used to govern this functionality, please see the specific documention of each end point for details.

        Metadata
      </H4>
      <p>
        Resources that support editing have a
        <code>
          metadata
        </code>
        attribute available in their payload. This attribute can be used to set a JSON data fragment against a specific resource by including the metadata attribute in POST and PATCH requests. This will subsequently be included in future fetches of that resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metadata should be used to store additional, structured information against an object. This allows our clients to build upon the resource returned by the API and create a point of integration between our platform and third party applications. A common use case would be to store a unique identifier from an external system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once metadata has been submitted to a representation, a JSON schema is built and used to validate future metadata submissions to the same endpoint to keep ensure that data is valid and consistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information stored in metadata is specific to your application and is not available to other Reapit or third party applications. Do not store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, bank details, etc.) as metadata.

        The Foundation platform uses 
        <a
          href="https://openid.net/connect/faq/"
        >
          OpenID Connect
        </a>
         (OIDC) as it's Authentication protocol, based on the OAuth 2.0 specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our authentication mechanisms allow you to quickly build apps on top of our platform and provide a seamless authentication experience for your end users.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Registering your application
      </H5>
      <p>
        Your application must be registered with our Marketplace before it can interact with data, functionality and assets provided by the Foundations API. For more information on how to register your application, see our Marketplace documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of creating your application, you'll be required to choose the
         
        <a
          href="https://oauth.net/2/scope/"
        >
          scopes 
        </a>
        that you application requires. Scopes govern the actions that your application can perform against our services. Each endpoint will detail the scopes that an application must be granted in order to interact with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your application has been successfully registered, you will be provided with a unique application id which is required to interact with our authorization services.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Client installation
      </H5>
      <p>
        Once your application submission has been approved by Reapit, it will appear as a listing in our Marketplace. Reapit clients will then be able to interact with your application's details and potentially choose to install it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the installation process, clients are required to agree to the scopes that your application requires before your application becomes accessible to end users. Applications cannot interact with client data or assets without prior approval from the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once installed, an application can access Foundation services on an end users behalf. The recommended way to achieve this is to use one of our Client Libraries, however you can interact directly with our APIs as detailed below.
      </p>
      <H5>
        Create an authorization code
      </H5>
      <p>
        To create an OAuth 
        <a
          href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/"
        >
          authorization code
        </a>
        , direct users to the URL documented below where they'll be prompted to enter their credentials. The clientId parameter is required and provided during the Marketplace app registration process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            GET https://foundations.reapit.com/oauth/authorize?clientId=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon success, the service will direct back to your application with an authorization code provided as a query string.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            https://application.company.com/?code=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <H5>
        Exchange code for tokens
      </H5>
      <p>
        If your application has successfully guided the end user through the OAuth flow and obtained an authorization code, you need to send it along with the client id issued to your application during Marketplace registration to the following endpoint:
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-4"
      >
        <pre>
          <code>
            POST https://foundations.reapit.com/oauth/access_token
            
  {
    "clientId" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "code" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuing a request with a valid authorization code and client id will provide a response in the following format:
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-4"
      >

        Developer Sandbox
      </H4>
      <p>
        You can use the Foundation API in Sandbox mode which provides a set of demonstration data that can be interacted with without affecting any client environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon registering with our developer portal, you can immediately get familiar with the functionality our APIs offer and enjoy a hurdle free route to start developing your application
      </p>
      <p>
        Sandbox mode supports processing of all read and write requests so that you can build and test in confidence before submitting your application to our Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the sandbox, you'll need to register for a developer account at our Portal. You're then able to simply use those credentials provide them to our Authorization services in the normal way. The access token generated for your developer credentials will point our APIs at your sandbox data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, our Interactive API Explorer will automatically grant access to sandbox data when you're logged into the Developer Portal.

        Resource expansion
      </H4>
      <p>
        Some of the top level resources made available by the platform include resource expansion functionality. When fetching data from a resource expansion enabled endpoint, clients can optionally request that a response includes data from one or more related resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ability is to designed to reduce the number of required client-server roundtrips to obtain the data that a client needs for a specific use-case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Query parameters are used to govern this functionality, please see the specific documention of each end point for details.

        Request

        Metadata
      </H4>
      <p>
        Resources that support editing have a
        <code>
          metadata
        </code>
        attribute available in their payload. This attribute can be used to set a JSON data fragment against a specific resource by including the metadata attribute in POST and PATCH requests. This will subsequently be included in future fetches of that resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metadata should be used to store additional, structured information against an object. This allows our clients to build upon the resource returned by the API and create a point of integration between our platform and third party applications. A common use case would be to store a unique identifier from an external system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once metadata has been submitted to a representation, a JSON schema is built and used to validate future metadata submissions to the same endpoint to keep ensure that data is valid and consistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information stored in metadata is specific to your application and is not available to other Reapit or third party applications. Do not store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, bank details, etc.) as metadata.
