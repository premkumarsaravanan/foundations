        Overview
      </H4>
      <p>
        Applications that are built on our Foundations Platform are able to communicate with Reapit's Agency Cloud CRM system. Using a well-defined API, you are able to trigger a wide variety of actions in our award-winning desktop application to augment your own applications and build a rich integration between systems.
      </p>
      <H4>
        URL Scheme
      </H4>
      <p>
        When a Marketplace application is launched and hosted within Agency Cloud, that application can interact with Agency Cloud by using our custom URI scheme. When a user triggers a link with an agencycloud: prefix, Agency Cloud will interpret that action and perform the corresponding action.
      </p>
      <H4>
        Format
      </H4>
      <p>
        Links are structured in a REST style to provide a well-defined and descriptive mechanism for interacting with the screens and functionality that Agency Cloud offers. The primary and secondary screens that exist in the Agency Cloud user interface broadly map to the REST notion of resources and sub-resources. Some actions also accept parameters which can be applied to the URI in the usual manner. Full documentation of the available interactions is listed below, grouped by primary screen.

        Agency Cloud Interaction API
      </H3>
      <H4>
        Overview
      </H4>
      <p>
        Not only can Applications built on the Foundations Platform trigger events in the Agency Cloud CRM system, but installed apps can also be associated with common actions in Agency Cloud to replace the default behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common way that this will manifest itself is by replacing a screen in Agency Cloud with an application. For example if you want to use an App to manage all of your AML and ID checking then you can associate the app with this action in Agency Cloud and every time you click to launch the ID check screen, the associated App will be presented instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another area which is possible to replace here is default functionality such as sending an SMS which currently is sometimes done now by hooking up to a 3rd party API, but instead purpose built app could provide a richer user experience to be able to edit the message before it is sent, and possibly choose the recipients of the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        All apps should be able to be launched from the Installed Apps screen and be ran standalone without the need to be linked to an action. They will just be hosted in the marketplace and launched in Agency Cloud – for example the Geo Diary application.
      </p>
      <H4>
        Categorisation
      </H4>
      <p>
        To be able to associate an application with an action in Agency Cloud the application will need to be given a category. This will be required so that Agency Cloud can be confident of the way the application will behave and that the application is agreeing to accept certain parameters when launched.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example – an AML or ID checking app will need to be able to accept a query parameter in the launch url of cntCode which tells the application which contact to show the ID checks for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Possible associations;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ID Check
        </li>
        <li>
          Property Detail Generation (print wizard)
        </li>

        Categories
      </H3>
      <H4>
        Id Check
      </H4>
      <p>
        The category of ID Check will be given to an application that can be used to replace the ID Check screen in Agency Cloud. The url that an application with this category would look like would be:
